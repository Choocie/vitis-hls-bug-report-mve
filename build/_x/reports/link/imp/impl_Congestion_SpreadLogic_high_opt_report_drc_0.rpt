AVALXA-268#1 Warning
CLK_DOM_COM_WF  
Cell vitis_design_i/VitisRegion/harness_1/inst/gmem0_m_axi_U/load_unit_0/buff_rdata/U_fifo_mem/mem_reg_bram_14: When cell attribute CLOCK_DOMAINS=COMMON, if cell attribute WRITE_MODE_A and WRITE_MODE_B are not READ_FIRST, there may be address collision if the same address appears on both read and write ports resulting in unknown or corrupted data. It is suggested to confirm via unisim simulation with SIM_COLLISION_CHECK != NONE that an address collision never occurs and if so try and avoid this situation. If address collisions cannot be avoided, the write-mode may be set to READ_FIRST which guarantees that the read data is the prior contents of the memory at the cost of additional power in the design. If address collision can be avoided, it is strongly suggested to change this mode to NO_CHANGE for better power characteristics. See the FPGA Memory Resources User Guide for additional information.
Related violations: <none>

DSP vitis_design_i/VitisRegion/harness_1/inst/inference_U0/grp_dut_fu_62/dense_relu_saturate_U0/tmp277_reg_11520_reg multiplier stage vitis_design_i/VitisRegion/harness_1/inst/inference_U0/grp_dut_fu_62/dense_relu_saturate_U0/tmp277_reg_11520_reg/P[57:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.  If there is no registered adder/accumulator following the multiply function, two pipeline stages are suggested to allow both the MREG and PREG registers to be used.  If the DSP48 was instantiated in the design, it is suggested to set both the MREG and PREG attributes to 1 when performing multiply functions.

REQP-2058#1 Warning
MBUFGCEDIV_CLR_or_CE_Pin_Active_and_MBUFGCEDIV_CLRBLEAF_Pin_Active  
For MBUFGCE_DIV cell vitis_design_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MBUFGCE_clkout1_inst, the vitis_design_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MBUFGCE_clkout1_inst/CE pin is tied to an active signal and the vitis_design_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MBUFGCE_clkout1_inst/CLRB_LEAF pin is tied to an active signal. To ensure proper startup on MBUFGCE_DIV O2,O3,O4 outputs you need to ensure that CLRB_LEAF pin is asserted and released before CLR pin is released with enough margin to satisfy the MBUFG*/CLRB_LEAF net route delay. See router message [Route 35-3345] in the router log file and 'Clock Primitives' section in UG1387 for more detail.
