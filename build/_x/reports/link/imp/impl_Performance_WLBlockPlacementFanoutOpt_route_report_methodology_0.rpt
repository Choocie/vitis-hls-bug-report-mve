2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
AVAL-344#1 Warning
Design_needs_USER_RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY_set  
The design property USER_RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY on the top-level current_design object is unset (or set to -1).  The estimated RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY used for the design is 10 and assumes a worst-case switching scenario for the URAM and BRAM.  RAM activity directly impacts clock uncertainty and the RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY property may not be accurate for designs that are not final.  It is recommended that the USER_RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY property be specified.  Please refer to the Versal ACAP Clocking Resources Architecture Manual and the Versal ACAP Hardware, IP, and Platform Development Methodology User Guide for more information on specifying the USER_RAM_AVERAGE_ACTIVITY.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-9#1 Warning
Unknown CDC Logic  
One or more asynchronous Clock Domain Crossing has been detected between 2 clock domains through a set_false_path or a set_clock_groups or set_max_delay -datapath_only constraint but no double-registers logic synchronizer has been found on the side of the capture clock. It is recommended to run report_cdc for a complete and detailed CDC coverage. Please consider using XPM_CDC to avoid Critical severities
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter NAME=~*/inst/trace_i/ep*/*]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '179' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

XDCB-5#2 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-through : [get_pins -hierarchical -filter NAME=~*/inst/trace_i/ep*/*]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '180' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

CLKC-69#1 Advisory
MMCME5 not driven by IO has BUFG in feedback loop  
The MMCME5 cell vitis_design_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MMCME5_inst has a BUFGCE vitis_design_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/BUFG_clkfbin_inst clock buffer in the feedback loop, but the clock input is not directly driven by an I/O to create a Zero Delay Buffer Clock (a common use for having a buffer in the feedback loop). If there is no specific need for this buffer in the feedback loop (e.g. no timing paths between CLKINx/CLKOUTx domains or low latency requirement), then it is suggested to remove that BUFG* from the feedback path. This will allow for a lower power solution and free the clock resource for other purposes.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-72#1 Advisory
Substitute PLL for MMCME5 check  
The MMCME5 cell vitis_design_i/VitisRegion/clk_wiz/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MMCME5_inst has a single input clock whose source driver, UNKNOWN, is not optimally located and the MMCM has a configuration which could be accommodated by a PLL.  Consider changing the MMCM to a PLL which could align better with the input clock driver.
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-75#1 Advisory
MMCME5 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME5 cell vitis_design_i/VitisRegion/clk_wiz/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MMCME5_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) vitis_design_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/BUFG_clkout4_inst and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
Related violations: <none>

CLKC-75#2 Advisory
MMCME5 with global clock driver has no LOC  
The MMCME5 cell vitis_design_i/clk_wizard_0/inst/clock_primitive_inst/MMCME5_inst CLKIN1 or CLKIN2 pin is driven by global Clock buffer(s) vitis_design_i/CIPS_0/inst/pspmc_0/inst/buffer_pl_clk_0.PL_CLK_0_BUFG and does not have a LOC constraint. It is recommended to LOC the MMCM and use the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint on the net(s) driven by the global Clock buffer(s).
Related violations: <none>

XDCB-6#1 Advisory
Timing constraint pointing to hierarchical pins  
A timing constraint 'set_false_path' has a single -through that points to hierarchical pins (see constraint position '179' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). With such constraint, it is recommended to have a DONT_TOUCH or KEEP_HIERARCHY on the hierarchical module to avoid the risk of pin names changing during synthesis.
